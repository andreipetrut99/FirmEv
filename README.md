"# FirmEv"
This is an GUI Java-Based App that keeps track of a service-management company
I used JDBC in order to connect my app to a MySQL Database. 
The GUI is made with SceneBuilder. 


If you want to use this app on your computer please make sure that:
  1. You have a MySQL Server running
  2. You can connect to the server using: "root" as username and "admin" as password
  3. You have imported the FirmEv database
  4. You have Java 15 SDK installed
  
All passwords saved in users table are encrypted with MD5 so in order to log in to FirmEv app as administrator use "petrut123"/"petrut123" credentials or just make a new account as a customer. 

Have fun.
